   Copyright and Licensing Information for CUTS(TM), OASIS, and GAME(TM).

   CUTS(TM)[1], OASIS, and GAME(TM) (hereafter referred to as "CUTS software")
   was authored and copyrighted by James H. Hill[2]. It is a resource of
   his research group at the Trustees of Indiana University[3] on behalf of
   Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis[4] (henceforth referred
   to as IUPUI), Copyright (c) 2009-2010, all rights reserved. Since CUTS
   software is open-source, freely available software, you are free to
   use, modify, copy, and distribute--perpetually and irrevocably--CUTS
   software source code and object code produced from the source, as well
   as copy and distribute modified versions of this software. You must,
   however, include this copyright statement along with any code built
   using CUTS software that you release. No copyright statement needs
   to be provided if you just ship binary executables of your software
   products.

   You can use CUTS software in commercial and/or binary software releases
   and are under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code
   that is built using CUTS software. Note, however, that you may not
   do anything to CUTS software code, such as copyrighting it yourself
   or claiming authorship of the CUTS software code, that will prevent
   CUTS software from being distributed freely using an open-source
   development model. You need not inform anyone that you're using CUTS
   software in your software, although we encourage you to let us[5]
   know so we can promote your project in the CUTS software success
   stories[6].

   The CUTS web site[1] is maintained by James H. Hill at Department
   of Computer and Informatin Science at IUPUI[7] for the development
   of open-source software as part of the open-source software community.
   Submissions are provided by the submitter ``as is'' with no warranties
   whatsoever, including any warranty of merchantability, noninfringement
   of third party intellectual property, or fitness for any particular
   purpose. In no event shall the submitter be liable for any direct,
   indirect, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages,
   including without limitation, lost profits, even if advised of the
   possibility of such damages. LIKEWISE, CUTS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS
   IS WITH NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF DESIGN,
   MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT,
   OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE. IUPUI,
   THEIR EMPLOYEES, AND STUDENTS SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO
   THE INFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS OR ANY PATENTS BY CUTS
   SOFTWARE OR ANY PART THEREOF. MOREOVER, IN NO EVENT WILL IUPUI, THEIR

   CUTS software is provided with no support and without any obligation
   on the part of IUPUI, their employees, or students to assist in its
   use, correction, modification, or enhancement.

   CUTS software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform
   is Y2K-compliant. Likewise, CUTS software is compliant with the new US
   daylight savings rule passed by Congress as "The Energy Policy Act of
   2005," which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for the
   United States that expand DST as of March 2007. Since CUTS software
   obtains time/date and calendaring information from operating systems
   users will not be affected by the new DST rules as long as they upgrade
   their operating systems accordingly.

   The name CUTS(TM) and IUPUI, may not be used to endorse or promote
   products or services derived from this source without express written
   permission from IUPUI. This license grants no permission to call products
   or services derived from this source CUTS(TM) nor does it grant permission
   for the name IUPUI to appear in their names.

   If you have any suggestions, additions, comments, or questions, please
   let me[5] know.
