I. Selecting Build Features
----------------------------
The first step in builing OASIS is to install the default features
file for your configuration. The default features controls what
parts of OASIS to build based on the selected features. To install
the default features file, copy the default build features file
template

  $OASIS_ROOT/default.features.tmpl

to the following location:

  $OASIS_ROOT/default.features

After installing the default build features file, next select what
features to build. This is done by enabling features in the installed
default featurs file. For example, to enable support for building
TENA parts of OASIS, set tena=1 in the default features file. To
disable a feature, set its feature to 0 (e.g., tena=0).

It is assumed that you have all required libraries installed for a
given feature. If the supporting libraries are not installed, then
there is a chance that parts of OASIS based on the enabled feature
will not build correctly.

II. Building OASIS
-------------------
OASIS uses the Makefile Project Workspace Creator (MPC) to support
cross-platform project generating and building. To build OASIS,
just execute the following steps:

%> $ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl -type [build type] OASIS.mwc
%> # build OASIS using generated workspace

For a complete set of build types supported by MPC, please execute
the following command:

%> $ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl -help
