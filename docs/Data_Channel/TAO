1. Overview
----------------------------
The ACE ORB (TAO) data channel provides network communication
between the Data Acquisition Controller (DAC) and the Embedded
Instrumentation (EI) node using the TAO middleware. The source
code for each endpoint of the TAO data channel is in the following
directories:

  $OASIS_ROOT/oasis/EINode/channel/tao
  $OASIS_ROOT/oasis/DataAcquisitionController/channel/tao

2. Command-line Parameters
----------------------------
Both endpoints of the TAO data channel accept the standard TAO
command-line options. In addition, each endpoint accepts command-line
options specific to OASIS.

The following are command-line options accepted by the EI node
endpoint of the TAO data channel:

 --no-orb           Do not run a private ORB. This is useful when
                    sharing an existing ORB in the process.

The following are command-line options accepted by the DAC
endpoint of the TAO data channel:

 -r,--run-orb       Run a private ORB. This endpoint will not use
                    the ORB created by the DAC, if one exists.
