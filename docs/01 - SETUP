I. Environment Setup
---------------------
Before you can build OASIS, you must first setup your environment.
This means defining the correct environment variables so that all
project in OASIS will build correctly. Outside of setting the
environment variables for any third-party libraries that OASIS uses,
the main environment variable that must be defined is:

  OASIS_ROOT

This environment variable should be set to the root directory of
OASIS. For example on Windows, you define it as follows:

  %> set OASIS_ROOT=<path to OASIS>

You then need to update the PATH variable (and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux and MacOS X, respectively) with
the location of OASIS library and binary directories. This can
be done as follows:

  %> set PATH=%PATH%;%OASIS_ROOT%\bin;%OASIS_ROOT%\lib

On non-Windows systems, %OASIS_ROOT%\lib should be added to
either LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on MacOS X.
