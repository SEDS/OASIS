1. Configuration File Format
-------------------------------------
The embedded instrumentation (EI) node can be configured using
a standard text file. This configuration file has the following
format:

  Name: [name]
  Uuid: [UUID]

  DataChannel:
    [data channel implementation]
    [software probe implementation]*

The Uuid: field is a user-defined Universal Unique Identifier for
the EI node. The host operating system usually has an application
that can be use to generate a UUID. The Name: field is the human
readable name of the EI node. We recommend that you do not use spaces
when defining the EI node's name.

The DataChannel: section is where you define the different data
channels supported by the EI node, and what software probes are
assigned to a given data channel. Currently, you can only have one
data channel section in an EI nodes configuration. Future versions
will support multiple data channels.

Both the data channel and software probe implementation section are
defined using ACE service configuration directives. The format of
a directive is as follows:

  dynamic [name] Service_Object * [library]:[symbol] () "[args]"

where:

  name - Unique name of service that contains no spaces
  library - shared library were object is contained
  symbol - export symbol/factory for creating service
  args - initialization arguments for probe

2. Loading Configuration via Command-line
-----------------------------------------------
Given a configuration, it is possible to configure an EI node via
the command-line. This is done when init (...) is called on the
EI node. If the command-line contains the following option:

  -c, --config=CONFIG

then the EI node loads the specified configuratation. This means
you do not have to manually invoke the load_configuration () method,
see below.

3. Manually Loading Configuration
------------------------------------
The other approach for configuring an EI node is to manually invoke
the load_configuration () method passing as a parameter the location
of the EI node's configuration file.

4. Known Data Channel Directives
------------------------------------
The following are directives for known data channels that are
provided with the OASIS distribution:

 Tao: dynamic TaoChannel Service_Object * OASIS_Tao_DataChannel_Client:_make_OASIS_Tao_Data_Channel_Client () " "
